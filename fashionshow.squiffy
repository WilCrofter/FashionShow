*Scene: The middle of nowhere.*

I caught the wrong bus!

I can't believe it! I'm supposed to be in Middle *School* and here I am in the middle of *nowhere*. What should I do? [Cry]? [Use my cell phone]? [Look around]? 

[Cry]:

**ME:** Boo-hoo!

OK. That felt good.

[Use my cell phone]:

There's no reception. This is the middle of nowhere.

[Look around]:

The only thing in sight is a ramshackle building with a sign I can't quite read. I'll need to [[move closer]].

[[move closer]]:

Now I can read the sign. It says, "Fashion Show in Progress." Really? A fashion show in the middle of nowhere? Why?

Uh-oh. Someone is coming. I don't know her but she looks oddly familiar.

**LO:** Hi there! I love your bell-bottoms. It's a real 80's look!

**ME:** Actually, I'm here by mistake. I need a ride back to Middle School.<br/><br/>
**LO:** Hmm. Well, I'm on the runway in five--the Late October look you know--but I'm sure someone inside can help you.<br/><br/>
**ME:** OK, thanks. By the way, what kind of material are you wearing? I've never seen that before.<br/><br/>
**LO:** Some kind of synthetic, I think. Gotta run. Good luck.<br/><br/>
**ME:** (Waving goodbye.) I like your hat!

That sign is confusing. The "MEN" arrow is above the lady icon and the "LADIES" arrow is above the man icon.

Maybe, instead of "LADIES" they meant "LADDIES" but misspelled it? And maybe the "MEN" label was once "WOMEN" but the "WO" got worn off?

I don't know which way to go. Should I go [[LEFT]](mens) or [[RIGHT]](mens)?

**ME:** You look strangely familiar.<br/><br/> 
**BUD:** *(Swaying, bobbing head,)* I get that. You part of the 80's look?<br/><br/>
**ME:** To tell the truth, I'm here by mistake. I need a ride back to Middle School.<br/><br/>
**BUD:** I get that. I bet THE GUY could help you out.<br/><br/> 
**ME:** The guy?<br/><br/> 
**BUD:** THE GUY. He runs the show.<br/><br/>
**ME:** Where can I find him?<br/><br/> 
**BUD:** He's usually in THE PLACE. It's through the dressing rooms, but you don't want to go through this one.<br/><br/>
**ME:** Right.<br/><br/>
**BUD:** It isn't pretty...well, actually, it is pretty. Still..<br/><br/>
**ME:** I'll go through the other one.<br/><br/>
**BUD:** I get that. Be cool.

+++Go to THE PLACE
@clear

*Scene: Outside THE PLACE. The door is closed. Machinery noise emerges.*

Wow! I've been knocking for five minutes. Maybe he can't hear me. It's really noisy in there. It seems impolite to [knock louder] but maybe I should. Or maybe I should [try something else]. What though?

[knock louder]:

Ouch! My knuckles are sore. I'll either have to [[try something else]] or start [kicking the door]. What should I do?

[kicking the door]:

He still can't hear me. Maybe he's not even in there. I'll have to [try something else].

[[try something else]]:

I don't know what to do. Should I [[look around]] or just [[give up]]?

[[give up]]:

Shoot! I've tripped over the door mat. Wait! There's key under it! Now I can use the key to [[unlock the door]].

[[look around]]:

All I can see is a door mat. Wait! People sometimes leave keys under doormats. 

Sure enough! Here's a key! I can use it to [[get in THE PLACE]](unlock the door). What luck!

[[unlock the door]]:

*Scene: THE PLACE. THE GUY is inside wearing noise-cancelling earphones. He takes them off. He looks surprised.*

**THE GUY:** Hey! Fashion models aren't supposed to see what's in here!<br/><br/>
**ME:** I'm not a fashion model! I'm here by mistake. I need a ride.<br/><br/>
**THE GUY:** You're not a fashion model? What about the bell bottoms?<br/><br/>
**ME:** The bell bottoms are another mistake! Listen, I just need a ride back to Middle School. I won't tell anyone what you're doing in here. What *are* you doing in here anyway?<br/><br/>
**THE GUY:** This is where I create my fashions.<br/><br/>
**ME:** The machines look like 3D printers.<br/><br/>
**THE GUY:** Yup. That's how I do it. I download the latest fashions from New York and 3D print them. You say you just need a ride?<br/><br/>
**ME:** That's all.<br/><br/>
**THE GUY:** As it happens, I've just 3D printed a folding bicycle. Will that do?<br/><br/>
**ME:** Sure. It's the best offer I've had today.<br/><br/>
**THE GUY:** When you get back, just fold up the bike and stick it in an envelope. Mail it to this address.<br/><br/>
**ME:** Carrotsville?<br/><br/>
**THE GUY:** Yeah. They used to grow a lot of carrots here. There's no money in it any more.<br/><br/>
**ME:** Thanks so much for your help.<br/><br/>
**THE GUY:** You're welcome. And, since you know my secret, if you ever want to become a fashion designer you know where to find me.

@clear
It was no problem to ride the bike back to Middle School. I was late, but as luck would have it there had been a fire drill as soon as everyone got to class and everyone was still outside. I folded up the bike and stuck it in my pocket. No one ever knew I was late. Except you. Don't tell.
