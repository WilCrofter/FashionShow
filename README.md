# Escape from the Fashion Show

**A prototype squiffy game designed to gauge interest among certain K-12 persons.**

Play the game [here](http://wilcrofter.github.io/fashionshow/index.html). 

This semester (Fall 2017) the K-12 educational establishment seems particularly interested in teaching game programming. CoderDojo, for instance, has a new nanobook, [Make Your Own Game](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/coderdojo-nano/) and the Raspberry Pi Foundation has a [new online course for teachers](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/text-based-futurelearn/) based on coding a text adventure game.

I'm no educator, but being the grand and great-grand progenitor of many K-12 persons, being aware that the number of *unfilled* programming jobs in the US is currently pushing 1 million, that productivity of the digital economy is [growing 2% faster than that of other sectors](http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2017/04/digital-forces-and-other-70-of-us.html), and that the digital economy's primary bottleneck is a shortage of talent, I'm very interested. And if educators think game coding will do the trick, it's worth a try. They know the turf after all.

Besides, text adventures are fun. Casting about, I discovered the online text adventure editor [Quest](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest), which kids can surely learn to use by themselves and maybe teach their parents. Interested in what goes on under the hood, I wrote this game directly in [Squiffy](https://github.com/textadventures/squiffy). Squiffy is very nice, IMO, much simpler for noobs than [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/), [TADS](http://www.tads.org/), etc.
